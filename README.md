# ManagementQuality

The performance of a business is often closely tied to the quality of its management. In this study, we aimed to investigate the factors influencing management quality within firms. Specifically, we explored the impact of various firm characteristics on management scores. The question we seeked to answer was: What factors contribute to variations in management quality across firms? This question holds significance as high-quality management is linked to improved performance and employee retention. We approached this inquiry through an econometric analysis, utilizing a comprehensive dataset and regression techniques.

How this related to the BCIS lerning goals:
By applying statistical modeling skills we identified business problems and crafted solution startegies sto solve these business problems. We cleaned up in unstructureddata and created visual graphs that explained the data nd helped us find a solution. By critical thinking we identified what questions to ask and what vcariables to combine to get the most reliable results out of our data set. This project also contributes to global responsibility by analyzing factors affecting management quality, which in turn impacts business performance, employee satisfaction, and potentially environmental sustainability.
